Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain. When a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body, it is called a thromboembolism. Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to. A common place is the lung, where the clot can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a stroke.</p></div></div></section><section><div class="section"><div class="section-header"><div class="section-title"><h2>Exams and Tests</h2></div><div class="section-button"><button type="submit" aria-controls="section-3" role="button" title="Expand/Collapse section"><span class="icon icon-section-action">

Cobalt poisoning	"<p>Cobalt is a naturally occurring element in the earth\'s crust. It is a very small part of our environment and very small amounts are needed for many animals and humans to stay healthy.</p><p>Cobalt poisoning can occur when you are exposed to large amounts of cobalt. There are three basic ways that cobalt can cause poisoning. You can swallow too much of it, breathe too much into your lungs, or have it come in constant contact with your skin.</p><p>Recently, cobalt poisoning has been seen from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants. This type of implant is an artificial hip socket that is created by fitting a metal ball into a metal cup. Sometimes, metal particles (cobalt) are released as the metal ball grinds against the metal cup when you walk. These metal particles (ions) can get released into the hip socket and sometimes the bloodstream, causing cobalt toxicity.</p><p>This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. </p></div>"	</div></div><div class="section-body" id="section-3"><p>Usually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms. However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at once.</p><p>The most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe too much into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air. Breathing in this cobalt dust can cause a lot of chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p>Cobalt poisoning that occurs from constant contact with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly.</p><p>Swallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous. It may cause nausea and vomiting. However, absorbing a large amount of cobalt over longer periods of time can lead to serious health problems, such as:</p><ul><li>Cardiomyopathy (a problem where your heart becomes big and floppy and has problems pumping blood)</li><li>Deafness</li><li>Nerve problems</li><li>Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)</li><li>Thickening of the blood</li><li>Thyroid problems </li></ul></div></div></section><section><div class="section"><div class="section-header"><div class="section-title"><h2>Home Care</h2></div><div class="section-button"><button type="submit" aria-controls="section-4" role="button" title="Expand/Collapse section"><span class="icon icon-section-action">

This stage can last 10 years or longer. During this period, the person might have no reason to suspect they have HIV, but they can spread the virus to others.</p><p>If they are not treated, almost all people infected with HIV will develop AIDS. Some people develop AIDS within a few years of infection. Others remain completely healthy after 10 or even 20 years. </p><p>People with AIDS have had their immune system damaged by HIV. They are at very high risk of getting infections that are uncommon in people with a healthy immune system. These infections are called opportunistic infections. These can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa, and can affect any part of the body. People with AIDS are also at higher risk for certain cancers, especially lymphomas and a skin cancer called <a test="test" href="./000661.htm">Kaposi sarcoma</a>.</p><p>Symptoms depend on the particular infection and which part of the body is infected. Lung infections are common in AIDS and usually cause cough, fever, and shortness of breath.

Mercury	""	</div></div><div class="section-body" id="section-3"><p>ELEMENTAL MERCURY</p><p>Elemental mercury is usually harmless if it is touched or swallowed. It is so thick and slippery that it usually falls off the skin or leaves the stomach and intestines without being absorbed.</p><p>A lot of damage can occur, though, if elemental mercury gets into the air in the form of small droplets that are breathed into the lungs. This often occurs by mistake when people try to vacuum up mercury that has spilled onto the ground.</p><p>Breathing in enough elemental mercury will cause symptoms right away. These are called acute symptoms. Long-term symptoms will occur if small amounts are inhaled over time. These are called chronic symptoms. Chronic symptoms may include:</p><ul><li><a test="test" href="./003050.htm">Metallic taste</a> in the mouth</li><li><a test="test" href="./003117.htm">Vomiting</a></li><li><a test="test" href="./003075.htm">Difficulty breathing</a></li><li>Bad cough</li><li>Swollen, bleeding gums</li></ul><p>Depending on how much mercury is inhaled, permanent lung damage and death may occur. Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur.</p><p>INORGANIC MERCURY</p><p>Unlike elemental mercury, inorganic mercury is usually poisonous when swallowed. Depending on how much is swallowed, symptoms may include:</p><ul><li>Burning in the stomach and throat</li><li>Bloody diarrhea and vomiting</li></ul><p>If inorganic mercury enters your bloodstream, it can attack the kidneys and brain. Permanent kidney damage and kidney failure may occur. A large amount in the bloodstream may cause massive blood and fluid loss from diarrhea and kidney failure, leading to death.</p><p>ORGANIC MERCURY</p><p>Organic mercury can cause sickness if it is breathed in, eaten, or placed on the skin over a long periods of time. Usually, organic mercury causes problems over years or decades, not right away. This means that being exposed to small amounts of organic mercury every day for years will likely cause symptoms to appear later. But, a single large exposure can also cause problems.</p><p>Long-term exposure will likely cause symptoms in the nervous system, including: </p><ul><li>Numbness or pain in certain parts of your skin</li><li>Uncontrollable shaking or tremor</li><li>Inability to walk well</li><li>Blindness and double vision</li><li>Memory problems</li><li>Seizures and death (with large exposures) </li></ul><p>Being exposed to large amounts of the organic mercury called methylmercury while pregnant may cause permanent brain damage in the baby. Most health care providers recommend eating less fish, especially swordfish, while pregnant. Women should talk to their provider about what they should and should not eat while pregnant.</p></div></div></section><section><div class="section"><div class="section-header"><div class="section-title"><h2>Before Calling Emergency</h2></div><div class="section-button"><button type="submit" aria-controls="section-4" role="button" title="Expand/Collapse section"><span class="icon icon-section-action">

Peripheral neuropathy	"<p>Peripheral nerves carry information to and from the brain.
